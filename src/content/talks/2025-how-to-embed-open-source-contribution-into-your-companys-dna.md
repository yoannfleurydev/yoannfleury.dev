title: How to Embed Open Source Contribution into Your Company's DNA
description: >
  Even with a sincere intention and strong commitment to contributing to open source, it’s not always easy—especially
  with a team that is technically diverse and evolves at different paces. At BearStudio, we’ve spent several years
  exploring how to make open source an integral part of our work, both as contributors to existing projects and as
  creators of our own. This talk is a candid, experience-driven look at what we’ve tried, what’s worked, and what hasn’t.

  We’ll dive into the practicalities of encouraging open source participation in a heterogeneous team: how to navigate
  varying skill levels, interests, and constraints; how to secure time for contributions without sacrificing client or
  internal priorities; and how to foster long-term engagement. Using examples from projects like JHipster and Start UI,
  as well as React libraries like Formiz and Ficus UI, we’ll illustrate the strategies and lessons that have shaped our
  approach.

  This is not about providing definitive answers but sharing nearly a decade of experiments and experiences at
  BearStudio. If you’re looking for grounded insights into the challenges and rewards of contributing to open source as
  a team, this talk aims to offer a realistic and practical perspective.
