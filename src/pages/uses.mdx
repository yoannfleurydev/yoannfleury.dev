# Softwares

## Editor

### VS Code

I am using VS Code as my main editor as I'm a Frontend developer, but I love
the comfort of IntelliJ for Java and PhpStorm for PHP if I need to work using
these languages.

I sometimes open Vim for some quick changes in the terminal.

Here is a quick listing of the extensions I installed on my VS Code (minus the
ones specific to languages):

- Better Comments `aaron-bond.better-comments`
- Color Highlight `naumovs.color-highlight`
- Dependi `fill-labs.dependi`
- Error Lens `usernamehw.errorlens`
- GitHub Actions `github.vscode-github-actions`
- GitHub Pull Request `GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github`
- GitLens `eamodio.gitlens`
- Peacock `johnpapa.vscode-peacock`
- Prettier `esbenp.prettier-vscode`
- Todo Tree `Gruntfuggly.todo-tree`
- Total TypeScript `mattpocock.ts-error-translator`
- Twoslash Query Comments `Orta.vscode-twoslash-queries`

As a theme for VS Code, I use `GitHub Dark Default` which is a revamped and
darker version of the previous `GitHub Dark`. In light mode, I use
`Atom One Light`. The mode changes based on the day time.

As a font, I use [Monaspace Neon](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace) from
GitHub. I have used [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/),
[Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)
and [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) in the past.

## Terminal

[Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) is my terminal of choice and [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
is my fallback. As a Shell, I'm using [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) and the prompt
is powered by [Starship](https://starship.rs/).

## Browser

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is my main browser for
personnal usage, and [Arc](https://arc.net/) is the one
I use professionally.
